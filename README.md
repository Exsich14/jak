# jak - Proggraming language

Jak is a simple and easy-to-understand programming language focused on learning and rapid prototyping. The language has a minimal but expressive set of constructs: screen output, branches, functions, changing and creating variables, constants, and basic data types.

Documentation and step-by-step tutorials are available in the Wiki section of the repository: https://github.com/Exsich14/jak/wiki

## Key ideas

- A clean and simple syntax model that is easy for beginners to understand.
- Explicit primitive types: `int`, `double`, `string`, `boolean`.
- Easy declaration of variables and constants.
- Functions as the basic unit of logic reuse.
- Flow control via `if/else` with familiar comparison operators.
